# athenaCL

athenaCL is an algorithmic composition tool created by Christopher Ariza.

Or, as described by the author on the [site](http://www.flexatone.org/article/athenaCLMain), it is a:
> modular poly-paradigm algorithmic music composition in a cross-platform interactive command-line environment.

This repo is a fork. The last commit in the original repo was in 2011.

Originally it's written in Python 2, this repo has an updated to Python 3 version.




## Installation

For installation and other instructions read [athenaCL/doc/README.txt](athenaCL/doc/README.txt).
Notice, information may be outdated in that README, but in overall it should be applicable.




## Status

So far all tests of the main module (`libATH`) passed and it seems like it 
works in the terminal.
But test coverage is far from 100% and many bugs introduced by the conversion may still exist.

For now, I don't have any plans to introduce new features, but if you'll find any bugs,
I'm ready to try to fix it when I have time, so fill free to open issues. Also, feel free to open PR's.

When I finish with the manual and fixing bugs I'd find in the examples of tutorials,
I'm going to keep it on "life support" - just fixing bugs, when I find some while using
the application as a normal user (i.e. not a tester).

I'd also like to add a front end to this application, but that would be a separate project.
