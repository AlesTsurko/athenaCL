      <title>Starting the athenaCL Interpreter</title>
      
      <para>Depending on your platform, there are a number of different ways to launch the athenaCL program and start the athenaCL Interpreter. For all platforms, using athenaCL requires installing (or finding) Python 2.6 (or better) on your system. Many advanced operating systems (UNIX-based operating systems including GNU/Linux and MacOS X) ship with Python installed.
      </para>
      
      <para>For complete instructions on installing and launching athenaCL in each platform, please see the file "README.txt" included in the athenaCL distribution and in <xref linkend="ax01"></xref>.
      </para>
      
      <para>After launching athenaCL, the user is presented with a text-based display in a terminal or Python-interactive window. The user is presented with the following initialization information:
      </para>

<example>
<title>Initialization information</title>

      <para>When starting up the Interpreter, athenaCL looks in the athenaCL directory for the "libATH" folder, and then various directories within the "libATH" folder. These directories contain essential files and must be present for the program to run. The athenaCL prompt "::" is preceded by information concerning the AthenaObject. This will be explained in greater detail below.

      <sect1 id="sect-commands">
      <title>Introduction to Commands</title>
      
      <para>When using athenaCL, the user enters commands to get things done. athenaCL commands are organized by prefixes, two-letter codes that designate what the command operates upon. Prefixes are always displayed as capitalized letters, though the user, when entering commands, may use lower-case letters. Some common prefixes are "PI", for PathInstance, or "TI", for TextureInstance. What follows the prefix usually resembles UNIX shell commands: "ls" for listing objects, "rm" for removing objects. For example, the command to list all the available TextureModules is TMls: "TM" for TextureModule, "ls" for list. When no common UNIX command-abbreviation is available, intuitive short abbreviations are used. For example, the command to create the retrograde of a PathInstance is PIret: "PI" for PathInstance, "ret" for retrograde.
      </para>
      
      <para>The division of commands into prefixes demonstrates, in part, the large-scale design of the AthenaObject. The AthenaObject consists of PathInstances and TextureInstances. PathInstances are objects that define pitch materials. TextureInstances define algorithmic music layers. Users can create, copy, edit and store collections of Paths and Textures within the AthenaObject. All Texture related commands, for example, start with a "T", like TextureTemperament ("TT"), TextureClone("TC") and TextureModule ("TM").
      </para>
      
      <para>In addition to the commands available for working with Paths and Textures, there are commands for creating various event list formats (such as Csound scores and MIDI files) with the EventList commands (prefix "EL"). The complete AthenaObject, with all its Paths and Textures, is handled with AthenaObject commands (prefix "AO"). These commands are used to save and control the complete collection of Paths and Textures.

      <sect1 id="sect-execute">
      <title>Executing Commands</title>
      
      <para>To use a command, simply enter its name. The user will be prompted for all additional information. For example, type "PIn" (or "pin") at the athenaCL prompt:
      </para>

<example>
<title>Entering a command</title>
<screen>
pi{}ti{} :: pin
name this PathInstance: a
enter a pitch set, sieve, spectrum, or set-class: b,c#,g
      SC 3-8B as (B4,C#4,G4)? (y, n, or cancel): y
      add another set? (y, n, or cancel): n
PI a added to PathInstances.
</screen></example>

      <para>This command prompts the user for a "pitch set, sieve, spectrum, or set-class" and then creates a multiset component of a Path. A Xenakis sieve (Xenakis 1990 [AN#327], 1992 [AN#60]; Ariza 2004 [AN#443], 2005 [AN#613], 2009 [AN#1990]) can be entered using a logical string and a pitch range. Set class labels are given using Forte names. The user may enter the chord itself as pitch-names (with sharps as "#" and flats as "$") or pitch-classes (integers that represent the notes of the chromatic scale) (Straus 1990 [AN#34]). For instance, the chord D-major can be represented with the following pitch-name string: (D, F#, A). Or, the same chord can be represented as a pitch class set: (2,6,9), where 0 is always C, 1=C#, 2=D, &hellip;, 10=A#, and 11=B. Calling the PIn command to create a new path named "b" with this pitch class set gives us the following results:
      </para>
<!-- 
      <para>Nearly all commands can operate both interactively, were the user is prompted for each argument, or with ordered, space-separated arguments provided at the command line. 
      </para>
 -->


<example>
<title>Entering a command with arguments</title>
<screen>
pi{a}ti{} :: pin b d,f#,a
PI b added to PathInstances.
</screen></example>
      
      <para>Notice that in the above example the Path name and pitch collection arguments are entered at the same time as the command: "pin b d,f#,a". As an interactive command-line program, athenaCL can obtain arguments from the user, and can, alternatively, accept space-separated arguments following a command. Command-line arguments allow advanced users ease and speed and, when called from an external environment (such as a UNIX shell or Python script), permit advanced scripting automation. All athenaCL commands can function both with arguments and with interactive prompts. Command-line arguments, however, are never required: if arguments are absent, the user is prompted for the necessary details.

      <title>Getting Help for Commands</title>
      
      <para>athenaCL provides two ways of helping the user access and learn commands. If the user only remembers the prefix of a command, this prefix can be entered at the prompt to produce a list of all commands associated with that prefix:
      </para>

PIn                 PIn: PathInstance: New: Create a new Path from user-
                    specified pitch groups. Users may specify pitch groups in a
                    variety of formats. A Forte set class number (6-23A), a
                    pitch-class set (4,3,9), a pitch-space set (-3, 23.2, 14),
                    standard pitch letter names (A, C##, E~, G#), MIDI note
                    numbers (58m, 62m), frequency values (222hz, 1403hz), a
                    Xenakis sieve (5&3|11), or an Audacity frequency-analysis
                    file (import) all may be provided. Pitches may be specified
                    by letter name (psName), pitch space (psReal), pitch class,
                    MIDI note number, or frequency. Pitch letter names may be
                    specified as follows: a sharp is represented as "#"; a flat
                    is represented as "$"; a quarter sharp is represented as
                    "~"; multiple sharps, quarter sharps, and flats are valid.
                    Octave numbers (where middle-C is C4) can be used with pitch
                    letter names to provide register. Pitch space values (as
                    well as pitch class) place C4 at 0.0. MIDI note numbers
                    place C4 at 60. Numerical representations may encode
                    microtones with additional decimal places. MIDI note-numbers
                    and frequency values must contain the appropriate unit as a
                    string ("m" or "hz"). Xenakis sieves are entered using logic
                    constructions of residual classes. Residual classes are
                    specified by a modulus and shift, where modulus 3 at shift 1
                    is notated 3@1. Logical operations are notated with "&"
                    (and), "|" (or), "^" (symmetric difference), and "-"
                    (complementation). Residual classes and logical operators
                    may be nested and grouped by use of braces ({}).
                    Complementation can be applied to a single residual class or
                    a group of residual classes. For example:
                    -{7@0|{-5@2&-4@3}}. When entering a sieve as a pitch set,
                    the logic string may be followed by two comma-separated
                    pitch notations for register bounds. For example "3@2|4, c1,
                    c4" will take the sieve between c1 and c4. Audacity
                    frequency-analysis files can be produced with the cross-
                    platform open-source audio editor Audacity. In Audacity,
                    under menu View, select Plot Spectrum, configure, and
                    export. The file must have a .txt extension. To use the
                    file-browser, enter "import"; to select the file from the
                    prompt, enter the complete file path, optionally followed by
                    a comma and the number of ranked pitches to read.

<example>
<title>Accessing additional help topics</title><screen>
pi{b}ti{} :: ? markov
{topic,documentation}
Markov Notation     Markov transition strings are entered using symbolic
                    definitions and incomplete n-order weight specifications.
                    The complete transition string consists of two parts: symbol
                    definition and weights. Symbols are defined with alphabetic
                    variable names, such as "a" or "b"; symbols may be numbers,
                    strings, or other objects. Key and value pairs are notated
                    as such: name{symbol}. Weights may be give in integers or
                    floating point values. All transitions not specified are
                    assumed to have equal weights. Weights are specified with
                    key and value pairs notated as such: transition{name=weight
                    | name=weight}. The ":" character is used as the zero-order
                    weight key. Higher order weight keys are specified using the
                    defined variable names separated by ":" characters. Weight
                    values are given with the variable name followed by an "="
                    and the desired weight. Multiple weights are separated by
                    the "|" character. All weights not specified, within a
                    defined transition, are assumed to be zero. For example, the
                    following string defines three variable names for the values
                    .2, 5, and 8 and provides a zero order weight for b at 50%,
                    a at 25%, and c at 25%: a{.2}b{5}c{8} :{a=1|b=2|c=1}.
                    N-order weights can be included in a transition string.
                    Thus, the following string adds first and second order
                    weights to the same symbol definitions: a{.2}b{5}c{8}
                    :{a=1|b=2|c=1} a:{c=2|a=1} c:{b=1} a:a:{a=3|b=9}
                    c:b:{a=2|b=7|c=4}. For greater generality, weight keys may
                    employ limited single-operator regular expressions within
                    transitions. Operators permitted are "*" (to match all
                    names), "-" (to not match a single name), and "|" (to match
                    any number of names). For example, a:*:{a=3|b=9} will match
                    "a" followed by any name; a:-b:{a=3|b=9} will match "a"
                    followed by any name that is not "b"; a:b|c:{a=3|b=9} will
                    match "a" followed by either "b" or "c".

In most cases, athenaCL will write a file in a user specified "scratch" directory with an automatically-generated file name. This is convenient and fast. To set the scratch directory, enter the APdir command, for AthenaPreferences directory. (Replace "/Volumes/xdisc/_scratch" with a complete file path to a suitable directory.)

      <para>The command PIh, for PathInstance hear, allows the creation of a MIDI file from a single Path specification. In this case, athenaCL writes the MIDI file in the user-specified scratch directory. After the file is written, athenaCL opens the file with the operating system. Depending on how the operating system is configured, the MIDI file should open in an appropriate player. The athenaCL system frequently works in this manner with the operating system and external programs and resources.
