# Tutorial 5: Textures and Paths

This tutorial demonstrates basic use of Paths within Textures. This chapter is
essential for understanding the use of Paths in algorithmic music production.



## Path Linking and Pitch Formation Redundancy

Textures link to Paths. Said another way, a Texture contains a reference to a
Path object stored in the AthenaObject. Numerous Textures can thus share the
same Path; further, if a change is made to this Path, all Textures will
reference the newly updated version of the Path.
      
Events generated by a Texture can derive pitch values from a sequence of many
transformations. These transformations allow the user to work with Pitch
materials in a wide variety of orientations and parametric specifications. One
or more Textures may share a single Path to derive pitch class or pitch space
pitch values. Each Texture has independent ParameterObject control of a local
transposition (local field) and a local register position (local octave), and
with most TextureModules this control can be configured to be applied once per
event or once per Path set. Finally, each Texture has a modular Temperament
object to provide microtonal and dynamic final pitch tuning. Ultimately, the
TextureModule is responsible for interpreting this final pitch value into a
linear, horizontal, or other event arrangement.
      
For example, a Texture may be linked to simple Path consisting of a single
pitch. This pitch will serve as a referential pitch value for all pitch
generation and transformation within the Texture. The Texture's local field and
local octave controls could then be used to produce a diverse collection of
Pitch values. Changing the single pitch of the Path would then provide global
transposition of Texture-based pitch processes. Alternatively, a Path may
specify a complex sequence of chord changes. Numerous Textures, linked to this
single Path, could each apply different local octave settings to distinguish
register, and could each apply different microtonal tunings with local field and
Temperament settings.
      



## Creating a Path with a Duration Fraction

First, the user creates a path consisting of three Multisets. As demonstrated in
, there are many ways to create and edit a Path. In the following example, the
user creates a new path named q1 by simply providing pitch space values using
conventional note names. The path is the then viewed with the PIv command, and
auditioned with the PIh command.
      

**Creating a Path with PIn**

```
pi{}ti{} :: pin
name this PathInstance: q1
enter a pitch set, sieve, spectrum, or set-class: D2,G#3,A3,D3,E2,B2,A2
      SC 5-29A as (D2,G#3,A3,D3,E2,B2,A2)? (y, n, or cancel): y
      add another set? (y, n, or cancel): y
enter a pitch set, sieve, spectrum, or set-class: C4,C#4,F#3,G4,A3
      SC 5-19A as (C4,C#4,F#3,G4,A3)? (y, n, or cancel): y
      add another set? (y, n, or cancel): y
enter a pitch set, sieve, spectrum, or set-class: G#5,A4,D#4,E5
      SC 4-8 as (G#5,A4,D#4,E5)? (y, n, or cancel): y
      add another set? (y, n, or cancel): n
PI q1 added to PathInstances.

pi{q1}ti{} :: piv
PI: q1
psPath              -22,-4,-3,-10,-20,-13,-15  0,1,-6,7,-3       20,9,3,16      
                    D2,G#3,A3,D3,E2,B2,A2      C4,C#4,F#3,G4,A3  G#5,A4,D#4,E5  
pcsPath             2,8,9,2,4,11,9             0,1,6,7,9         8,9,3,4        
scPath              5-29A                      5-19A             4-8            
durFraction         1(33%)                     1(33%)            1(33%)

pi{q1}ti{} :: pih
PI q1 hear with TM LineGroove complete.
(/Volumes/xdisc/_scratch/ath2010.07.03.19.05.21.mid)
```

As should be clear from the psPath display or the auditioned MIDI file, Path q1
covers a wide pitch range, from E2 to G#5. Notice also that the "durFraction"
specifies that each Multiset in the Path has an equal duration weighting (1, or
33%). The durFraction of a Path is a means of providing a proportional temporal
weighting to each Multiset in the Path. When a Texture interprets a Path, it
partitions its duration into as many segments as there are Path Multisets, and
each segment is given a duration proportional to the Path durFraction. The
command PIdf can be used to alter a Path's duration weighting. The user must
supply a list of values, either as percentages (floating point or integer) or
simply as numeric weightings. In the following example, after calling PIdf, the
command PIh is used to audition the results of an altered durFraction:
      

**Altering a Path's durFraction with PIdf**

```
pi{q1}ti{} :: pidf

PI q1 edited.

pi{q1}ti{} :: piv

                    D2,G#3,A3,D3,E2,B2,A2      C4,C#4,F#3,G4,A3  G#5,A4,D#4,E5  
pcsPath             2,8,9,2,4,11,9             0,1,6,7,9         8,9,3,4        
scPath              5-29A                      5-19A             4-8            
durFraction         8(50%)                     5(31%)            3(19%)         
TI References: none.

pi{q1}ti{} :: pih
PI q1 hear with TM LineGroove complete.
(/Volumes/xdisc/_scratch/ath2010.07.03.19.08.09.mid)
```

The PIv display shows that the Multisets are weighted such that the first is
given 50%, the second 31%, and the last 19%. The MIDI file created with PIh
should confirm this distribution.
      



## Setting EventMode and Creating a Texture

As explained in , the athenaCL EventMode determines what instruments are
available for Texture creation. In the following example, the EventMode is set
to midi, the TextureModule LiteralVertical is selected, a new Texture is created
with instrument 0, and the Texture is displayed with TIv.
      

**Creating a Texture with TM LiteralVertical**

```
pi{q1}ti{} :: emo midi

      s4            pathDurationFraction, on
texture (d)ynamic   none     
```

Notice that the Texture's Path attribute is set to q1. In all cases, a Texture,
when created, links to the active Path. The Path a Texture links to can be
edited later if necessary. Notice also that the Path listing in the TIv display
shows the pitches of the Path, as well as timings for each set: 10, 6.25, and
3.74 seconds respectively. These times are the result of the duration fraction
applied to the Texture's duration.
      
To hear this Texture, create an EventList as explained in . After using the ELn
command, the ELh command can be used to open the MIDI file. Notice that each
chord lasts the appropriate duration fraction of the total twenty-second
duration of the Texture.
      
A few small edits to this Texture will make it more interesting. In the
following example, both the rhythm and amplitude are edited: the rhythm is given
more Pulses and made to oscillate back and forth along the specified series; the
amplitude randomly selects from a list of four amplitudes.
      

**Editing a Texture**

```
pi{q1}ti{a1} :: tie r l, ((4,1,1), (4,1,1), (4,3,0), (2,3,1), (3,2,1), (3,2,1)), oo
TI a1: parameter rhythm updated.

pi{q1}ti{a1} :: tie a bg, rc, (.5,.6,.8,1) 
TI a1: parameter amplitude updated.
```

Again, ELn and ELh can be used to create and audition the resulting musical
structure.
      



## PitchMode

PitchMode is a Texture attribute that controls the interpretation of the Path
from inside a TextureInstance.
      
PitchMode determines if a Path is represented to the Texture as a pitch space
set, a pitch class set, or set class. As a pitch space set, a Texture performs
register information included in a Path. The set (1,11,24), performed as a pitch
space set, would consist of a C-sharp, a B-natural a minor seventh above the
lowest pitch, and C-natural an octave and major-seventh above the lowest
pitch. The set (1,11,24) performed as a pitch-class set, would be interpreted as
the set (1,11,0): register information is removed, while pitch class is
retained. The set (1,11,24), performed as a set-class, would be interpreted as
the set (0,1,2): register and pitch-class are removed, while the normal-form of
the set-class is retained.
      
In the following example, a new Texture is created from TextureModule
LineGroove. First, the TM must be selected with the TMo command. Next, a new
Texture named b1 is created with the TIn command. The TImode command can be used
to edit many Texture options. In this example, pitchMode is selected and "pcs,"
for pitch class space, is selected. Finally, the Texture is given a more
interesting rhythm, by use of the Rhythm ParameterObject markovPulse, and is
panned to the right with a constant value:
      

**Editing PitchMode of a TextureInstance**

```
pi{q1}ti{a1} :: tmo lg

      s3            levelOctaveMonophonic, event

```

Because Path q1 is still active, this new Texture is assigned the same Path as
Texture a1. After setting the Texture's pitchMode to pitchClassSpace, however,
Texture b1 will receive only pitch class values from Path q1: all register
information, as performed in Texture a1, is stripped. By creating a new
EventList with ELn and auditioning the results, it should be clear that both
Textures share the same pitch information and duration weighting. Notice that
the faster-moving single-note line Texture b1, however, stays within a single
register. When a Texture is in pitchClassSpace Pitch mode, all pitches from a
Path are interpreted within the octave from C4 to C5.
      



## Editing Local Octave

With a Texture's local field and local octave controls, ParameterObjects can be
used to alter the pitches derived from a Path. In most TextureModules, the
transformation offered by field and octave control can be applied either once
per Multiset, or once per event. This is set by editing the TextureStatic
options levelField and levelOctave.
      
In the following example, the local octave attribute of Texture b1 is edited
such that octaves are chosen in order from a list of possibilities, creating a
sequence of octave transpositions. An octave value of 0 means no transposition;
an octave of -2 means a transposition two octaves down.
      

**Editing Local Octave**

```
pi{q1}ti{b1} :: tie

pi{q1}ti{b1} :: tiv

                    (constant, 0)

                    (D2,G#3,A3,D3,E2,B2,A2),(C4,C#4,F#3,G4,A3),(G#5,A4,D#4,E5)
                    10.00(s), 6.25(s), 3.75(s)
local (f)ield       constant, 0

(a)mplitude         randomBeta, 0.4, 0.4, (constant, 0.7), (constant, 0.9)
pan(n)ing           constant, 0.9
au(x)iliary         none

      s0            parallelMotionList, (), 0.0
      s1            pitchSelectorControl, randomPermutate

      s3            levelOctaveMonophonic, event
texture (d)ynamic   none
```

Listening to the results of the previous edit (with ELn and ELh), it should be
clear that a new octave is applied to each event of Texture b1, creating an
regular oscillation of register independent of Path Multiset.
      
Alternatively, the user may desire local octave and field controls to only be
applied once per Multiset. This option can be set for TextureModule LineGroove
by editing the TextureStatic parameter "levelOctaveMonophonic." In the following
example, the user examines the documentation of ParameterObject
levelOctaveMonophonic, and a copy of Texture b1 is created named b2. Next, this
Texture's panning is edited, and then the TextureStatic option
levelOctaveMonophonic is changed from "event" to "set":
      

**Editing TextureStatic**

```

Listening to a new EventList created with these three Textures (with ELn and
ELh), it should be clear that all pitch information is synchronized by use of a
common Path. In the case of Texture a1, the pitches are taken directly from the
Path with register. In the case of Texture b1 (right channel), the Path pitches,
without register, are transposed into various registers for each event. In the
case of Texture b2 (left channel), the Path pitches, also without register, are
transposed into various registers only once per Multiset.
      



## Editing Local Field and Temperament

Within athenaCL, any pitch can be tuned to microtonal specifications, allowing
the user to apply non-equal tempered frequencies to each pitch in either a fixed
relationship or a dynamic, algorithmically generated manner. Within athenaCL
Textures there are two ways to provide microtonal tunings. First, pitches can be
transposed and tuned with any ParameterObject by using the Texture local field
attribute. Each integer represents a half-step transposition, and floating point
values can provide any detail of microtonal specification. Second, each Texture
can have a different Temperament, or tuning system based on either pitch class,
pitch space, or algorithmic specification. The command TTls allows the user to
list the available TextureTemperaments.
      

**Listing all TextureTemperaments**

```
pi{q1}ti{b2} :: ttls
TextureTemperaments available for TI b2:
{name,tunning}
 + TwelveEqual       
   Pythagorean       
   Just              
   MeanTone          
   Split24Upper      
   Split24Lower      
   Interleave24Even  
   Interleave24Odd   
   NoiseLight        
   NoiseMedium       
   NoiseHeavy        
```

The temperament "TwelveEqual" is the active Temperament for current Texture
b2. This temperament produces equal-tempered frequencies. To select a different
temperament for the active Texture, enter the command TTo. In the example below
the user selects the temperament NoiseLight for Textures b2 and Texture b1, and
then selects the temperament NoiseMedium for Texture a1. In the last case, two
command are given on the some command line. As is the UNIX convention, the
commands and arguments are separated by a semicolon:

**Selecting Texture Temperament with TTo**

```
pi{q1}ti{b2} :: tto
select a TextureTemperament for TI b2: (name or number 1-11): nl
TT NoiseLight now active for TI b2.

pi{q1}ti{b2} :: tio b1
TI b1 now active.

pi{q1}ti{b1} :: tto nl
TT NoiseLight now active for TI b1.

pi{q1}ti{b1} :: tio a1; tto nm
TI a1 now active.

TT NoiseMedium now active for TI a1.
```

Not all EventOutputs can perform microtones. MIDI files, for example, cannot
store microtonal specifications of pitch. Though such pitches will be generated
within athenaCL, they will be rounded when written to the MIDI
file. EventOutputs for Csound, however, can handle microtones.
