## Creating athenaCL Generator ParameterObjects within Csound

Within Csound 5.0 orchestras, Python scripts can be written and objects from Python libraries can be instantiated and processed. Numerous Generator ParameterObjects and other athenaCL objects can be created, modified, and called from within Csound instruments. For complete examples, see the detailed articles on the topic (Ariza [AN#1824], [AN#1990]).
