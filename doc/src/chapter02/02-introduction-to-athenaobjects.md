## Introduction to AthenaObjects

The AthenaObject stores the collection of user-created PathInstances and TextureInstances, as well as the names of the active objects and other settings relevant to the active athenaCL session (and not stored in the user preference file). The AthenaObject, when saved, is stored as an XML file. When athenaCL creates an XML AthenaObject file, the resulting file contains the complete state of the active AthenaObject.
